# Clients

This is the home of multi-language clients for [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro)

## Overview

Micro clients are protobuf based code generated clients for use with the micro runtime. This is to unlock 
the ability to develop micro services in any language without the need for a full framework. Clients 
are ideally offloading everything to micro itself. 

## Languages

Soon...

## Getting Started

The proxy address localhost:8081 should be used as the fixed entry point for all requests.
