# Clients

This is the home of multi-language clients for [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro)

## Overview

Micro clients are multi-language clients for accessing Micro services. They provide a way for applications in any language to access Micro services. We take the approach of code generating clients based on gRPC protos and separately creating idiomatic libraries for each language.

## Clients

- Go
- Node
- Angular
- Java
- Proto
- gRPC

## Getting Started

See each sub-directory for the appropriate client and an example in the readme.

The sdk directory contains gRPC generated clients for the runtime.

## Developement

See the [development](https://github.com/micro/development/blob/master/design/clients) repo or join #development on slack.
